#ICEBOX:
- Add ability to set timer length on start screen
- CREATE A FUNCTION THAT RESETS THE DICE TO "ROLL THE DICE" WHEN THE TIMER HITS 0
- Between entering your value and confirm, have an "evaluate" button that makes sure what is typed in is valid (if it's not valid the thing that was typed in shouldn't disappear). Moreover, the evaluate button should check that all 4 numbers are used and no other numbers are used. 
- - After the expression has been evaluated, the evaluated amount is shown and the confirm button is present.
- - if time runs out and there is a number that has been evaluated, it is submitted.
- the evaluate/confirm button is disabled if the dice aren't rolled/timer is at 0.
